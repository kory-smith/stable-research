This highly-requested feature will significantly benefit our business users.\\n\\n![](./screenshot.png)\\n\\n## One Manager Node, Multiple Worker Nodes\\n\\nUnder the hood, Easypanel utilizes Docker Swarm. Our newest implementation now enables you to add multiple worker nodes. When deploying services, the workload will be evenly distributed across all your servers. If you happen to remove a worker node, the workload from that server will be automatically redistributed amongst the remaining nodes.\\n\\nPlease note that Easypanel currently does not support multiple manager nodes, meaning you will not achieve a fully redundant infrastructure. If redundancy is essential for your use case, you can set up two separate Easypanel clusters and place a managed load balancer in front of them.\\n\\n## Ideal for Stateless Services\\n\\nMulti-server support is best suited for stateless services - those which do not store any data on the local disk or can afford data loss upon restart.\\n\\nIt is crucial to design your applications in such a way that they can effectively leverage stateless services as much as possible. There are numerous strategies for accomplishing this, one of which includes utilizing object storage services like AWS S3 or self-hosted MinIO.\\n\\n## License Enforcement on the Horizon\\n\\nDuring the beta phase, our multi-server support is accessible for everyone to try. However, as we transition towards a stable release, this feature will be exclusively available to users with business licenses.\\n\\nStarting from May 1st, license enforcement will be in effect. Premium features will then become accessible only for servers with active licenses.\\n\\n## Stay Connected\\n\\nIf you want to stay up-to-date with new features or template releases in Easypanel, join our Discord server and follow us on Twitter.

That\'s why backups are so important. With Easypanel\'s new database backup feature, you can rest easy knowing that your data is safe and sound. Whether you\'re dealing with data corruption, accidental deletion, or some other unforeseen issue, you can quickly restore your data and get back to business as usual.\\n\\n## Works with Your Favorite Database\\n\\nEasypanel\'s database backup feature is compatible with all database services, including MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres, and MongoDB. So no matter what database you\'re working with, you can easily back up your data without breaking a sweat.\\n\\n## Store Your Backups in Cloud\\n\\nYou can store your backups with any S3 compatible storage provider. Here are a few of them: AWS S3, Digitalocean Spaces, Wasabi, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage, Backblaze B2, Minio, OpenStack Swift, IBM Cloud Object Storage. This gives you the flexibility to choose the storage provider that works best for you.\\n\\n## Set It and Forget It\\n\\nRunning backups manually can be a pain, which is why we\'ve made it easy to schedule backups at regular intervals. This way, you can set it and forget it, knowing that your data is always backed up and secure.\\n\\n## Upcoming Improvements\\n\\nWe\'re not done yet - we\'re always working to make our platform better. We\'ll be working on some new improvements, including the ability to restore backups directly from Easypanel and to automatically prune old backups.\\n\\n## Try It Out Today\\n\\nSo there you have it - Easypanel\'s new database backup feature. We hope you\'ll give it a try and let us know what you think. As always, we appreciate your feedback and are committed to making our platform the best it can be.

We\'ve been hard at work building some amazing new features that we\'re excited to share with you.\\n\\n## Over 120 templates\\n\\nWe\'re super stoked about how amazing our community has been lately. They\'ve generously contributed and now we\'ve got over 120 templates to choose from. Check them out over here!\\n\\n## Multi-user support & access control\\n\\nBut that\'s not all - this week, we\'re thrilled to announce that we\'ll be rolling out multi-user support and user access control per project. So whether you\'re working solo or with a team, you\'ll have the control you need to get things done.\\n\\n## Coming up next\\n\\nAnd just when you thought things couldn\'t get any better, we\'re also launching two-factor authentication next week. It\'s an extra layer of security that we think will give you some extra peace of mind.\\n\\nFinally, we wanted to let you know that we\'re working on database backups, which will be coming your way soon.\\n\\n## Join on Discord, Follow on Twitter\\n\\nIf you want to be the first to know about new features or new templates in Easypanel, you can join our Discord server.

I just wanted to give you a brief update on the latest features we\u2019ve added to Easypanel.\\n\\n![](./screenshot.png)\\n\\n## Resource Monitoring\\n\\nOne of the most requested features was resource monitoring. It\u2019s finally here! While the most advanced users knew how to inspect and check out what is going on their servers, most users were running blind.\\n\\nNow you can check the system-level stats on your dashboard. On top of that, you can check the service-level stats on the service page.\\n\\n## New Dashboard\\n\\nThe previous dashboard was\u2026 boring. Instead of displaying just the list of your projects, now you can see all the services at the first glance.\\n\\n## Other Improvements\\n\\n- Support basic auth\\n- Better volumes/mounts\\n- Native MariaDB service\\n- Prune Docker images button\\n- Start/stop buttons for all services\\n\\n## Docker Compose to Easypanel\\n\\nFrom the beginning of the project, people were asking about `docker-compose.yml` support. While that is very tricky to implement directly, a member of our community built a tool to convert your `docker-compose.yml` to Easypanel Schema.\\n\\nKudos to Raven Br\xf6tzmann! Go ahead and checkout his tool and don\u2019t forget to give a start on the Github repository.\\n\\n- [https://compose-to-easypanel.netlify.app/](https://compose-to-easypanel.netlify.app)\\n- [https://github.com/ravenbroetzmann/compose-to-easypanel](https://github.com/ravenbroetzmann/compose-to-easypanel)\\n\\n## 10+ New Templates\\n\\nThe community was very active lately.
