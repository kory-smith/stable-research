## Description

Nango is a powerful app designed to simplify and accelerate the process of building integrations. It provides a unified API, allowing you to drastically simplify your integration code and avoid dealing with each external API&#39;s schema and quirks. With Nango, you can authorize any integration using our drop-in UI, and securely manage your users&#39; credentials. The app also enables continuous data synchronization with external APIs, using one of 100+ pre-built integrations, or you can customize them or build your own. Nango also supports 2-way syncs, write-backs, and real-time webhooks. It&#39;s designed for engineering teams that want full control without the hassle, allowing you to build exactly the integration your customers need, in code. With Nango, you can leave the maintenance, scaling, and API specific quirks to us, and focus on what you do best.
