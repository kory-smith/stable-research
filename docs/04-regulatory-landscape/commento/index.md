1-Click installation template for Commento on Easypanel

## Description

Commento is a comments widget designed to enhance the interaction on your website. It allows your readers to contribute to the discussion by upvoting comments that add value and downvoting those that don&#39;t. The widget supports markdown formatting, enabling bold, italics, external links, quotes, bullet points, code, and more. Commento also provides moderation tools to manage the conversation, allowing you to lock heated threads, remove off-topic comments, and enforce timeouts. It features a spam detection system, saving you the hassle of dealing with spammers. The widget supports nested replies, making discussions easier to follow. Importantly, Commento does not require your readers to sign up, reducing friction and encouraging more interaction. You can easily customize the look of the widget to match your website&#39;s aesthetics.
