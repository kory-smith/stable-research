## Description

Thumbor is an intelligent imaging service designed to streamline and enhance your image processing tasks. It offers on-demand cropping, resizing, and flipping of images, ensuring the most important parts of your pictures are always preserved. Leveraging advanced face and feature detection algorithms, Thumbor smartly identifies key points in an image for optimal cropping and resizing. It also supports a variety of image filters for post-processing, which can be applied in a sequence for desired effects. Filters include brightness, contrast, grayscale, red-eye, and blur, among others. Thumbor also supports the WebP format, a superior image format that compresses better than jpeg and png, improving your website&#39;s performance. With Thumbor, you can store and load images from any location, and it&#39;s easy to implement a new loader or storage. It&#39;s a complete solution for your imaging needs, from uploading images to rendering them with smart face-recognition cropping.
