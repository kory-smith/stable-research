1-Click installation template for ToolJet on Easypanel

## Description

ToolJet is an open-source low-code framework designed to help you build and deploy custom internal tools with ease. It comes with a built-in database, ToolJet DB, built on top of PostgreSQL, and also allows you to connect to external data sources such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MS SQL Server, Snowflake, BigQuery, and more. You can also connect to API/GraphQL endpoints, SaaS tools like Airtable, Stripe, Google Sheets, and cloud object storage services like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Minio. Once connected, ToolJet can run queries on these data sources to fetch and update data. The fetched data can be visualized and modified using UI widgets like tables, charts, forms, etc. You can also use Javascript or Python queries for writing business logic or interacting with the user interface of the application. With ToolJet, you can build apps in three simple steps: connect to data sources, build queries, and build the user interface using the visual App Builder. ToolJet binds together the data sources, queries, and components to convert business logic into custom applications.
