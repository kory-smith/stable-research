# Vaultwarden

1-Click installation template for Vaultwarden on Easypanel

## Description

Vaultwarden is an unofficial Bitwarden server implementation designed for self-hosted deployments. It is written in Rust and is compatible with the official Bitwarden clients. This application is ideal for individuals, families, and smaller organizations who find the official resource-heavy service undesirable. Vaultwarden supports a wide range of features including personal and organization vault support, password sharing and access control, file attachments, two-step login via email, Duo, YubiKey, and FIDO2 WebAuthn, and many more. It also supports live sync for desktop/browser clients/extensions and mobile clients (Android/iOS). However, it does not prioritize the development of features mainly useful to larger organizations such as single sign-on and directory syncing.

## Instructions

To access the administration interface, please go to /admin on your installation url. The admin token is in your &quot;Environment&quot; tab.
