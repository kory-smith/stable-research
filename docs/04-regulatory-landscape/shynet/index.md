## Description

Shynet is a powerful, open-source analytics tool designed to provide you with clear, comprehensive insights about your website&#39;s traffic and user behavior. Unlike traditional analytics platforms, Shynet respects user privacy and does not track individual users across websites. Instead, it focuses on providing aggregate data and trends, helping you understand how users interact with your website as a whole. Shynet offers a range of features including real-time analytics, session tracking, and primary key integration. It also supports single-page applications, ensuring you get accurate data even when users navigate between pages within your application. With Shynet, you can easily create and manage multiple services, each with its own unique tracking script. The app also offers an API, allowing you to access all the information displayed on the dashboard programmatically. Whether you&#39;re a small business owner, a web developer, or a data analyst, Shynet provides you with the tools you need to make informed decisions about your website.
