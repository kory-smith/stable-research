## Description

Statping is a web and app status monitoring tool designed for any type of project. It automatically fetches your application and generates a beautiful, feature-rich status page. This status page generator supports MySQL, Postgres, or SQLite on multiple operating systems, ensuring future-proof and resilient monitoring. If your server crashes, your Statping service will remain online to notify your users of downtime. Lightweight and fast, Statping is available for Linux, Mac, and Windows, and even on a Raspberry Pi. The mobile app, available on the App Store and Google Play, allows you to view services, receive notifications when a service is offline, and manage groups, users, services, and messages. Statping can run on any server, from Docker to AWS EC2, and offers custom SASS styling for complete customization of your status page. It includes email notification via SMTP and Slack integration, and allows you to create your own plugins to interact with every element of your status page. With its easy-to-use dashboard, you can monitor your websites and applications with a basic HTTP GET request or a POST request with your own JSON.
