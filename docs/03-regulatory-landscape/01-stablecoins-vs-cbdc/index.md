# **CBDC vs. Stablecoins: Policy Considerations for the Digital Economy**  

**Ongoing study. Available March 2025. Contact us if you'd like access.**  

In the evolving landscape of digital finance, policymakers face a critical choice: Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) or privately issued stablecoins? This research dissects the fundamental trade-offs between the two models, offering a structured analysis of their implications for financial stability, innovation, and national sovereignty.  

## **Key Themes Explored**  

- **Defining the Ideal:** What conditions create the most effective CBDC or stablecoin? We explore core design considerations—security, privacy, accessibility, monetary policy control, and technological robustness.  
- **Which Serves Countries Better?** We first ask a fundamental question: Are CBDCs or stablecoins truly necessary? From financial inclusion to cross-border transactions, we evaluate whether existing financial systems suffice or if digital alternatives offer unique advantages. We then explore real-world use cases where CBDCs may outperform stablecoins—and vice versa. For instance, could a domestic digital token for international tourists boost tourism?  
- **Should Policymakers Take an Active Role?** Beyond mere adoption, should governments build their own digital currencies, regulate private stablecoins, or incentivize specific models? What factors should influence this decision?  
- **Coexistence or Competition?** Can private stablecoins and state-backed digital currencies thrive side by side? We explore hybrid models, such as the U.S., which appears to be moving away from a CBDC while allowing state-level initiatives like Wyoming's **USDW**—a government-issued, fully reserved stablecoin. What does this signal for the broader financial ecosystem, and could it serve as a model for other nations?   
- **Global Interoperability and Governance:** When private issuers like Circle engage in monetary discussions with governments such as Singapore’s, how should standards, compliance, and cross-border coordination be structured? What lessons can be drawn for global monetary networks?  
- **Beyond the Currency Layer:** Stablecoins are just the beginning. This research emphasizes the need for policymakers to look at broader financial infrastructure—liquidity pools, interoperability protocols, and programmable financial systems—that will shape the next era of digital finance.  

This report challenges the conventional “either-or” debate, advocating for a more nuanced understanding of digital financial ecosystems. Policymakers in the stablecoin era face a critical dilemma: intervene too little, and sovereignty may erode; intervene too much, and innovation could be stifled. Striking the right balance is essential. As central banks and private innovators shape the future, the fundamental question remains: **What role should government play in fostering an open, resilient, and secure digital economy?**
