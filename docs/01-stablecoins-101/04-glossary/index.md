# Stablecoin Glossary

### **Algorithmic Stablecoin**
A type of stablecoin that uses smart contracts and economic incentives to maintain its peg without direct collateral backing.

### **Arbitrage**
The practice of buying and selling a stablecoin across different markets to take advantage of price differences, helping maintain its peg.

### **Backing**
The assets or mechanisms that ensure a stablecoin maintains its value, such as fiat currency, crypto reserves, or algorithmic adjustments.

### **Burn Mechanism**
A process in which stablecoins are permanently removed from circulation, often to reduce supply and stabilize price.

### **Centralized Stablecoin**
A stablecoin issued and managed by a central entity, often backed by fiat reserves held in traditional banks.

### **Collateralization**
The use of assets, such as fiat or crypto, to back the issuance of a stablecoin.

### **Crypto-Collateralized Stablecoin**
A stablecoin backed by cryptocurrency reserves, usually over-collateralized to account for volatility.

### **Depegging**
A situation where a stablecoin’s market price deviates significantly from its intended peg.

### **Decentralized Stablecoin**
A stablecoin that operates without a central issuer and relies on smart contracts and decentralized governance.

### **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**
A blockchain-based financial ecosystem that offers permissionless (and sometimes trustless) financial services without reliance on traditional intermediaries.

### **Fiat-Backed Stablecoin**
A stablecoin backed 1:1 by fiat currency reserves held in banks or equivalent financial instruments.

### **Floating Peg**
A system where a stablecoin’s value is designed to fluctuate within a certain range rather than maintaining a fixed 1:1 peg.

### **Governance Token**
A token that allows holders to participate in decision-making processes for a stablecoin protocol.

### **Hybrid Stablecoin**
A stablecoin that combines multiple stabilization mechanisms, such as partial collateralization with algorithmic adjustments.

### **Lending Market Integrations**
The incorporation of stablecoins or Real World Assets into Decentralized Finance lending protocols, enabling borrowing and lending with on-chain collateralization.

### **Liquidity Pool**
A smart contract-based reserve of assets used to facilitate stablecoin trading and maintain price stability.

### **Market Maker**
An entity or algorithm that provides liquidity by continuously buying and selling stablecoins to maintain price stability.

### **On/Off-Ramps**
Services that allow users to convert between fiat currency and crypto assets (on-ramps) or vice versa (off-ramps), facilitating seamless entry and exit from blockchain ecosystems.

### **Over-Collateralization**
A mechanism where stablecoins are backed by reserves worth more than the circulating supply to prevent depegging.

### **Peg**
The target value that a stablecoin aims to maintain, typically tied to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar.

### **Peg Stability Mechanism**
A set of mechanisms, including arbitrage and collateralization, used to maintain a stablecoin’s value.

### **Real-World Asset (RWA)**
A tangible or financial asset, such as real estate, bonds, or commodities, that is represented and traded on-chain via tokenization.

### **Reserve Transparency**
The practice of providing publicly accessible proof of reserves to verify a stablecoin’s backing.

### **Seigniorage**
The profit generated by the issuance of a stablecoin, particularly in algorithmic models that expand and contract supply.

### **Smart Contract**
A self-executing contract with coded terms that govern the issuance and management of decentralized stablecoins.

### **Swap Pools**
Liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that facilitate the swapping of assets, including stablecoins.

### **Tokenization (of Stablecoins)**
The process of converting real-world assets or stablecoin reserves into blockchain-based tokens, enabling fractional ownership, increased liquidity, and programmable financial interactions.

### **TradFi (Traditional Finance)**
The conventional financial system, including banks, investment firms, and regulated financial institutions that operate under centralized oversight and established regulatory frameworks.

### **Volatility Buffer**
A risk-management feature in stablecoin protocols that mitigates price swings by holding additional collateral.

### **Yield-Bearing Stablecoin**
A stablecoin that generates passive income for holders by earning yield through mechanisms such as lending, staking, or protocol revenue sharing.

### **Yield Farming**
A strategy where users provide liquidity or stake assets in DeFi protocols to earn rewards, often in the form of additional tokens or protocol fees.
