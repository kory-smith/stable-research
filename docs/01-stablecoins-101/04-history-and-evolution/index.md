# Nest.js

Nest.js is a popular web application framework built with Node.js and TypeScript, offering a scalable and modular approach to developing server-side applications. Easypanel is a user-friendly web hosting control panel that simplifies server management, including deployment and configuration of web applications. This guide will walk you through deploying a Nest.js application on Easypanel, allowing you to access it via a public URL.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An existing Nest.js application on your local machine.
- Easypanel installed and running on your server.

## Step 1 - Creating a New Project on Easypanel

1. Log in to your Easypanel account.
2. Click the "New" button to create a new project.
3. Provide a name for your project.
4. Click "Create" to complete the project creation process.

## Step 2 - Setting up Your Application Service

After creating the project, proceed with setting up your application service, which represents your Nest.js application:

1. Within the project dashboard, click "+ Service."
2. Choose "App" as the service type.

## Step 3 - Configuring the Git/GitHub Source

If you plan to deploy your Nest.js application from a repository, configure the Git repository source in Easypanel:

## Step 4 - Choosing the Build Method

For deploying your Nest.js application, you have two recommended methods:

- Nixpacks: A package manager that simplifies building Node.js applications. You can use Nixpacks to define the environment for your Nest.js application and automate the build process.
- Dockerfile: Docker is a containerization technology that allows you to package your Nest.js application with its dependencies and deploy it as a container. You can use a Dockerfile to define the environment for your Nest.js application and automate the build process.

To select your build method:

1. Go to the "Build" tab within your application service.
2. Choose either Nixpacks or Dockerfile based on your preferences and requirements.
3. Configure the selected method as needed.
4. Save your changes, and a prompt to "Deploy" will appear.
5. Click "Deploy" to initiate the deployment process.

If you choose to deploy your app using a Dockerfile, you will need to specify the relative path to the Dockerfile inside your repository.

## Step 5 - Setting up Your Environment

Configure the environment variables required for your Nest.js application using Easypanel's "Environment" tab:

1. Navigate to the "Environment" tab within your application service.
2. Define the necessary key-value pairs for your environment variables.
3. Save the changes to apply the environment configurations.
4. Press "Deploy" to ensure the changes take effect in your running application.
