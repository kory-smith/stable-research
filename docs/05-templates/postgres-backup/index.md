# Postgres Backup

1-Click installation template for Postgres Backup on Easypanel

## Description

The postgres-backup-s3 app is a powerful tool designed to backup your PostgreSQL databases to Amazon S3. It supports periodic backups, allowing you to schedule automatic backups at your convenience. This ensures that your data is always safe and can be restored whenever needed. The app also offers the option to backup all available databases at once, creating a single archive with a timestamp for easy identification. For added security, the app provides an encryption feature. By setting an encryption password, your backup can be encrypted and only decrypted with the correct password. This app is perfect for those who want to ensure their PostgreSQL databases are securely backed up in a reliable and efficient manner.

## Instructions

In order to test that you configured it properly, remove the SCHEDULE variable from the environment, click deploy and check the logs. If everything works fine, you can add the SCHEDULE variable back. You can read more about the environment variables here: https://github.com/schickling/dockerfiles/tree/master/postgres-backup-s3
