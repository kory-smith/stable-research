## Description

LinkStack is a powerful open-source alternative to Linktree, designed to provide an efficient solution for managing and sharing links online.

With LinkStack, users can easily link to their own custom page and provide their followers with access to all the links they need in one convenient location. LinkStack also offers a self-hosted option for users who want complete control over their data without having it sold to third-party companies. The platform can be easily implemented through a simple drag and drop process, eliminating the need for complex terminal commands or source code manipulation. LinkStack is committed to providing a free, privacy-focused solution for managing and sharing links online, without sacrificing user privacy and control over their data.
