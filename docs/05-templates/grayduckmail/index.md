## Description

Gray Duck Mail is a user-friendly email discussion list application that offers an alternative to traditional email discussion group software. It is designed to be simple to set up and manage, making the process of running an email discussion list effortless. Gray Duck Mail is perfect for managing mailing lists between small to medium size groups, such as neighborhoods, schools, workplaces, and families. With Gray Duck Mail, you can send one email and automatically keep everyone in the loop. The application monitors a remote mail server for messages and processes them by relaying the message to all list members. It also automatically handles user subscriptions, unsubscription requests, and email bounces. Gray Duck Mail works with any external email host that allows for POP3/SMTP connections and message forwarding or aliasing. It relies totally on an external mail provider, allowing you to use an existing web host or email account.
