1-Click installation template for Trilium Notes on Easypanel

## Description

Trilium is a hierarchical note-taking application designed for creating and managing large personal knowledge bases. With Trilium, you can arrange your notes into an arbitrarily deep tree structure, with the ability to place a single note in multiple locations. The app offers rich WYSIWYG note editing, including tables, images, and math, with markdown autoformat. It also supports editing notes with source code, complete with syntax highlighting. Trilium provides seamless note versioning and attributes for note organization, querying, and advanced scripting. The app also includes a synchronization feature with a self-hosted sync server. For enhanced security, Trilium offers strong note encryption with per-note granularity. Other features include sketching diagrams with built-in Excalidraw, visualizing notes and their relations with relation maps and link maps, and a REST API for automation. Trilium is optimized for both usability and performance, capable of handling upwards of 100,000 notes.
