# Flask

Flask is a lightweight and versatile web framework built with Python, offering a straightforward approach to developing web applications. Easypanel is a user-friendly web hosting control panel that simplifies server management, including the deployment and configuration of web applications. This guide will take you through the process of deploying a Flask application on Easypanel, making it accessible via a public URL.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- An operational Flask application on your local machine.
- Easypanel installed and running on your server.

## Step 1 - Creating a New Project on Easypanel

## Step 4 - Choosing the Build Method

Easypanel offers two methods to deploy your Flask application:

- Nixpacks: A package manager that simplifies building Python applications. You can use Nixpacks to define the environment for your Flask application and build it automatically.
- Dockerfile: Docker is a containerization technology that allows you to package your Flask application with its dependencies and deploy it as a container. You can use a Dockerfile to define the environment for your Flask application and build it automatically.

To select your build method:

1. Go to the "Build" tab within your application service.
2. Choose either Nixpacks or Dockerfile based on your preferences and requirements.
3. Configure the selected method as needed.
4. Save your changes, and a prompt to "Deploy" will appear.
5. Click on "Deploy" to initiate the deployment process.

If you are using a Dockerfile, specify the relative path to the Dockerfile inside your repository.

## Step 5 - Setting up Your Environment

Configure the environment variables required for your Flask application using Easypanel's "Environment" tab:

1. Navigate to the "Environment" tab within your application service.
2. Define the necessary key-value pairs for your environment variables.
3. Save the changes to apply the environment configurations.
4. Press "Deploy" to ensure the changes take effect in your running application.
