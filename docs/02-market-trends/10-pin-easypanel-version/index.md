# Pin Easypanel version

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of pinning a specific version of Easypanel to prevent it from being automatically updated when the service restarts. This is achieved by setting the environment variable `RELEASE_TAG` to a specific version. Follow the steps below to update these settings and gain more control over your Easypanel updates.

## Finding available release tags

To pin Easypanel to a specific version, you first need to know which versions are available. You can find a list of all possible release tags on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/easypanel/easypanel/tags).

## Method 1: Using Portainer to set the `RELEASE_TAG`

If you have installed [Portainer](/docs/templates/portainer), you can easily set or change the `RELEASE_TAG` environment variable for Easypanel using the following steps:

 1. Open Portainer and navigate to the Services section.
 2. Find and click on the service named easypanel.
 3. Go to the Environment variables section.
 4. Look for the `RELEASE_TAG` variable. If it doesnâ€™t exist, add it; if it does, modify its value to the desired version tag (e.g., `1.50.0`).
 5. Apply the changes.

## Method 2: Pinning the Easypanel version via Command Line

You can also pin the Easypanel version by running a Docker command directly. Below is an example command to pin the version to `1.50.0`:

```shell
docker run --rm -it \
  -v /etc/easypanel:/etc/easypanel \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
  -e RELEASE_TAG=1.50.0 \
  easypanel/easypanel:1.50.0 setup
```

## Summary

By following the steps above, you can easily pin Easypanel to a specific version, ensuring that it does not automatically update when the service restarts. This gives you better control over your environment and avoids potential issues with unwanted updates.
