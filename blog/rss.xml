            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are thrilled to announce our latest development - multi-server support! This highly-requested feature will significantly benefit our business users.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/stable-research/assets/images/screenshot-33c403cc7e98632341a2c3a0801967d0.png" width="2400" height="1350" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="one-manager-node-multiple-worker-nodes">One Manager Node, Multiple Worker Nodes<a href="#one-manager-node-multiple-worker-nodes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to One Manager Node, Multiple Worker Nodes" title="Direct link to One Manager Node, Multiple Worker Nodes">â€‹</a></h2><p>Under the hood, Easypanel utilizes Docker Swarm. Our newest implementation now enables you to add multiple worker nodes. When deploying services, the workload will be evenly distributed across all your servers. If you happen to remove a worker node, the workload from that server will be automatically redistributed amongst the remaining nodes.</p><p>Please note that Easypanel currently does not support multiple manager nodes, meaning you will not achieve a fully redundant infrastructure. If redundancy is essential for your use case, you can set up two separate Easypanel clusters and place a managed load balancer in front of them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ideal-for-stateless-services">Ideal for Stateless Services<a href="#ideal-for-stateless-services" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ideal for Stateless Services" title="Direct link to Ideal for Stateless Services">â€‹</a></h2><p>Multi-server support is best suited for stateless services - those which do not store any data on the local disk or can afford data loss upon restart.</p><p>It is crucial to design your applications in such a way that they can effectively leverage stateless services as much as possible. There are numerous strategies for accomplishing this, one of which includes utilizing object storage services like AWS S3 or self-hosted MinIO.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="license-enforcement-on-the-horizon">License Enforcement on the Horizon<a href="#license-enforcement-on-the-horizon" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to License Enforcement on the Horizon" title="Direct link to License Enforcement on the Horizon">â€‹</a></h2><p>During the beta phase, our multi-server support is accessible for everyone to try. However, as we transition towards a stable release, this feature will be exclusively available to users with business licenses.</p><p>Starting from May 1st, license enforcement will be in effect. Premium features will then become accessible only for servers with active licenses.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stay-connected">Stay Connected<a href="#stay-connected" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stay Connected" title="Direct link to Stay Connected">â€‹</a></h2><p>If you want to stay up-to-date with new features or template releases in Easypanel, join our Discord server and follow us on Twitter.

This gives you the flexibility to choose the storage provider that works best for you.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="set-it-and-forget-it">Set It and Forget It<a href="#set-it-and-forget-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Set It and Forget It" title="Direct link to Set It and Forget It">â€‹</a></h2><p>Running backups manually can be a pain, which is why we've made it easy to schedule backups at regular intervals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey there!</p><p>It's been a while since we last chatted, but it's not because we've been slacking off! We've been hard at work building some amazing new features that we're excited to share with you.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="over-120-templates">Over 120 templates<a href="#over-120-templates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Over 120 templates" title="Direct link to Over 120 templates">â€‹</a></h2><p>We're super stoked about how amazing our community has been lately. They've generously contributed and now we've got over 120 templates to choose from. Check them out over here!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="multi-user-support--access-control">Multi-user support &amp; access control<a href="#multi-user-support--access-control" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Multi-user support &amp; access control" title="Direct link to Multi-user support &amp; access control">â€‹</a></h2><p>But that's not all - this week, we're thrilled to announce that we'll be rolling out multi-user support and user access control per project. So whether you're working solo or with a team, you'll have the control you need to get things done.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="coming-up-next">Coming up next<a href="#coming-up-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Coming up next" title="Direct link to Coming up next">â€‹</a></h2><p>And just when you thought things couldn't get any better, we're also launching two-factor authentication next week. It's an extra layer of security that we think will give you some extra peace of mind.</p><p>Finally, we wanted to let you know that we're working on database backups, which will be coming your way soon.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="join-on-discord-follow-on-twitter">Join on Discord, Follow on Twitter<a href="#join-on-discord-follow-on-twitter" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Join on Discord, Follow on Twitter" title="Direct link to Join on Discord, Follow on Twitter">â€‹</a></h2><p>If you want to be the first to know about new features or new templates in Easypanel, you can join our Discord server.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy Friday! I just wanted to give you a brief update on the latest features weâ€™ve added to Easypanel.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/stable-research/assets/images/screenshot-d1359f7cf3d2116eadf310077549abd6.png" width="2880" height="1590" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="resource-monitoring">Resource Monitoring<a href="#resource-monitoring" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Resource Monitoring" title="Direct link to Resource Monitoring">â€‹</a></h2><p>One of the most requested features was resource monitoring. Itâ€™s finally here! While the most advanced users knew how to inspect and check out what is going on their servers, most users were running blind.</p><p>Now you can check the system-level stats on your dashboard. On top of that, you can check the service-level stats on the service page.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-dashboard">New Dashboard<a href="#new-dashboard" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New Dashboard" title="Direct link to New Dashboard">â€‹</a></h2><p>The previous dashboard wasâ€¦ boring.

While that is very tricky to implement directly, a member of our community built a tool to convert your <code>docker-compose.yml</code> to Easypanel Schema.</p><p>Kudos to Raven BrÃ¶tzmann! Go ahead and checkout his tool and donâ€™t forget to give a start on the Github repository.</p><ul><li><a href="https://compose-to-easypanel.netlify.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://compose-to-easypanel.netlify.app/</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/ravenbroetzmann/compose-to-easypanel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/ravenbroetzmann/compose-to-easypanel</a></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="10-new-templates">10+ New Templates<a href="#10-new-templates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 10+ New Templates" title="Direct link to 10+ New Templates">â€‹</a></h2><p>The community was very active lately.
